Color Theory Exercise on Value

In color theory, value is the lightness or darkness of a color. This transcends hue. To help train your eyes to detect the value of a color, change the gray on the right to match the value (lightness or darkness) of the color on the left. When you've matched the value to the best of your ability, save the match.
